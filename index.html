		<h1>JavaScript Lesson 2 - April 13 to 17</h1>
		
		Hello everyone,
		This week you will deal with comments and variables in JavaScript.  <br>
		
		I've included a video explaining how to code variables and the HTML file that was used.  I've also included a word document that contains some of the "scratch notes" in case that helps.  After you watch the video and study the file, please try the exercises below.  <br>

		Good luck and feel free to reach out if you are having any issues.  (ajpauls@cloud.edu.pe.ca)
